Interview homework assignment

This is the repository for Liquibase Community interview homework assignments. Each subfolder contains an individual assignment. During our interview process, we will give candidates one of these assignments and let them work on it for a week offline. Our followup interview will discuss the various aspects about the solution the candidate built.

Why we open source

Liquibase is an open source project and we believe in building in public. These homework assignments are challenging, but they represent the type of work we'd expect you to do in your new Liquibase community role. Plus,
* Open sourcing our assignments makes it easy for people to suggest improvements.
* It's a convenient way to share assignments with candiates.
